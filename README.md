# nanoimage

Fork of an [awesome library](https://github.com/des256/image_formats/tree/master) by Desmond Germans, 2019
With some code from Makepad  
And some hacks to make it easier to use with *quads.

Why not image? Clean compilation time for image: 44s and +600Mb in /target, for image_formats: 0.5s and +6Mb in /target

Why not `zune` (https://github.com/etemesi254/zune-image.git)? Honestly, I just noticed `zune` existance too late. It might be a better choice!
